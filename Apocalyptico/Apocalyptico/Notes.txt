NOTE: Reminders

Making Sure that you are only working on your own scene and that all functions/scripts are working correctly before commit. Always remember to sync...

Do not change or modify any scripts in the Scripts folder unless you wrote it!! 

You can create another folder and name it just like your scene: Name_Script, then copy and paste the script you did like to fiddle with and modify it for testing.
